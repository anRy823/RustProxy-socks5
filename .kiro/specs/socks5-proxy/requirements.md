# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a high-performance, secure, and feature-rich SOCKS5 proxy server in Rust. The proxy will support the full SOCKS5 protocol specification, provide authentication mechanisms, access control, monitoring capabilities, and advanced routing features. The system is designed to scale from a simple development proxy to a production-ready service capable of handling enterprise workloads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core TCP Server Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic async TCP server that can accept connections and handle multiple clients concurrently, so that I have a solid foundation for building the SOCKS5 protocol implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL bind to port 1080 by default
2. WHEN a client connects THEN the server SHALL accept the connection and spawn a new async task
3. WHEN multiple clients connect simultaneously THEN the server SHALL handle all connections concurrently
4. WHEN a client sends data THEN the server SHALL be able to read and echo it back for testing purposes
5. WHEN the server encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error and continue serving other clients

### Requirement 2: SOCKS5 Protocol Implementation

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to connect through a compliant SOCKS5 proxy, so that I can route my traffic through the proxy server according to the SOCKS5 specification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a greeting with version 0x05 THEN the server SHALL respond with the chosen authentication method
2. WHEN no authentication is required THEN the server SHALL respond with method 0x00
3. WHEN a client sends a CONNECT request THEN the server SHALL parse the command, address type, destination, and port
4. WHEN the address type is IPv4 (0x01) THEN the server SHALL parse a 4-byte IP address
5. WHEN the address type is domain (0x03) THEN the server SHALL parse the domain name length and string
6. WHEN the address type is IPv6 (0x04) THEN the server SHALL parse a 16-byte IPv6 address
7. WHEN the connection request is valid THEN the server SHALL respond with success status 0x00
8. WHEN the connection request is invalid THEN the server SHALL respond with appropriate error codes

### Requirement 3: Data Relay Functionality

**User Story:** As a client, I want my data to be efficiently forwarded between me and the target server through the proxy, so that I can communicate with remote services transparently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SOCKS5 handshake completes THEN the server SHALL establish a connection to the target destination
2. WHEN the target connection is established THEN the server SHALL begin bidirectional data relay
3. WHEN data is received from the client THEN the server SHALL forward it to the target server
4. WHEN data is received from the target THEN the server SHALL forward it to the client
5. WHEN either connection closes THEN the server SHALL gracefully close both connections
6. WHEN a connection error occurs THEN the server SHALL log the error and clean up resources
7. WHEN data transfer completes THEN the server SHALL log connection statistics including bytes transferred and duration

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control who can use the proxy and what they can access, so that I can maintain security and prevent unauthorized usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN username/password authentication is enabled THEN the server SHALL implement SOCKS5 auth method 0x02
2. WHEN a user provides credentials THEN the server SHALL validate them against the configured user database
3. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the server SHALL reject the connection
4. WHEN access control rules are configured THEN the server SHALL block connections to restricted destinations
5. WHEN rate limiting is enabled THEN the server SHALL throttle connections per IP or user account
6. WHEN a user exceeds rate limits THEN the server SHALL temporarily block further connections
7. WHEN authentication fails repeatedly THEN the server SHALL implement progressive delays or IP blocking

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the proxy server without recompiling code, so that I can adapt the server to different environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from a TOML or YAML file
2. WHEN no config file exists THEN the server SHALL use sensible defaults
3. WHEN the config file changes THEN the server SHALL reload the configuration without restarting
4. WHEN command-line arguments are provided THEN they SHALL override config file settings
5. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the server SHALL log errors and use defaults
6. WHEN user accounts are configured THEN the server SHALL load them from the config file
7. WHEN access control rules are defined THEN the server SHALL apply them to incoming connections

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can track proxy usage, performance, and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connections are made THEN the server SHALL log structured information including source IP, destination, and timestamp
2. WHEN data is transferred THEN the server SHALL track and log bytes transferred in both directions
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the server SHALL log detailed error information with context
4. WHEN metrics are requested THEN the server SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics
5. WHEN the server is running THEN it SHALL provide real-time statistics on active connections
6. WHEN connection patterns are analyzed THEN the server SHALL provide insights into usage trends
7. WHEN performance monitoring is enabled THEN the server SHALL track latency and throughput metrics

### Requirement 7: Advanced Routing Features

**User Story:** As a power user, I want intelligent routing capabilities and traffic filtering, so that I can optimize performance and implement custom traffic policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN smart routing is enabled THEN the server SHALL select optimal routes based on latency or performance metrics
2. WHEN GeoIP filtering is configured THEN the server SHALL route or block traffic based on geographic location
3. WHEN custom rules are defined THEN the server SHALL apply domain-based routing, blocking, or redirection
4. WHEN proxy chaining is configured THEN the server SHALL route traffic through upstream proxies
5. WHEN TLS encryption is enabled THEN the server SHALL encrypt traffic between client and proxy
6. WHEN Tor integration is configured THEN the server SHALL route selected traffic through Tor network
7. WHEN traffic analysis is performed THEN the server SHALL provide insights into destination patterns

### Requirement 8: Production Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the proxy to be deployable and scalable in production environments, so that I can provide reliable proxy services at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed as a system service THEN the server SHALL start automatically on boot
2. WHEN containerized THEN the server SHALL run reliably in Docker containers
3. WHEN scaling is required THEN the server SHALL support deployment across multiple nodes
4. WHEN remote management is needed THEN the server SHALL provide REST API for administration
5. WHEN graceful shutdown is requested THEN the server SHALL close connections cleanly
6. WHEN resource limits are reached THEN the server SHALL handle overload gracefully
7. WHEN high availability is required THEN the server SHALL support clustering and failover

### Requirement 9: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the proxy to be hardened against attacks and abuse, so that it can operate safely in hostile network environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection timeouts are configured THEN the server SHALL drop idle connections automatically
2. WHEN brute force attacks are detected THEN the server SHALL implement progressive delays and IP blocking
3. WHEN secrets are used THEN the server SHALL store them securely using encryption or secure vaults
4. WHEN DDoS protection is enabled THEN the server SHALL limit connection rates and detect abuse patterns
5. WHEN security scanning is performed THEN the server SHALL pass standard proxy security tests
