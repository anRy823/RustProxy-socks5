# Transparent Proxy Requirements

## Introduction

This feature adds transparent proxying capabilities to the SOCKS5 proxy, allowing applications to be proxied without any configuration or awareness. Applications will connect normally while all traffic is automatically routed through the proxy server, making the proxy completely invisible to the application layer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: HTTP/HTTPS Traffic Interception

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to intercept HTTP and HTTPS traffic transparently, so that web applications don't need proxy configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application makes an HTTP request THEN the system SHALL intercept the request and route it through the SOCKS5 proxy
2. WHEN an application makes an HTTPS CONNECT request THEN the system SHALL establish a tunnel through the SOCKS5 proxy
3. WHEN HTTP traffic is intercepted THEN the application SHALL receive responses as if connecting directly
4. WHEN HTTPS traffic is intercepted THEN SSL/TLS handshakes SHALL work normally through the proxy tunnel
5. IF the SOCKS5 proxy requires authentication THEN the transparent proxy SHALL handle authentication automatically

### Requirement 2: DNS Query Hijacking

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to intercept DNS queries, so that domain resolution can be controlled and routed through the proxy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application performs a DNS lookup THEN the system SHALL intercept the DNS query
2. WHEN a DNS query is intercepted THEN the system SHALL return a controlled IP address that routes through the proxy
3. WHEN DNS responses are sent THEN applications SHALL receive valid DNS responses
4. IF DNS hijacking is enabled THEN all domain lookups SHALL be redirected to the proxy system
5. WHEN DNS hijacking is disabled THEN normal DNS resolution SHALL continue unchanged

### Requirement 3: System Proxy Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the system proxy settings to be automatically configured, so that applications use the proxy without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transparent mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically configure OS proxy settings
2. WHEN the proxy is stopped THEN the system SHALL restore original proxy settings
3. WHEN system proxy is configured THEN applications using system proxy settings SHALL automatically use the transparent proxy
4. IF the system requires administrator privileges THEN the system SHALL prompt for elevation
5. WHEN proxy settings are applied THEN bypass rules SHALL be configured for localhost and local networks

### Requirement 4: TUN/TAP Interface Support

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want to create a virtual network interface, so that all network traffic can be transparently routed through the proxy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TUN interface mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL create a virtual network interface
2. WHEN traffic flows through the TUN interface THEN it SHALL be automatically routed through the SOCKS5 proxy
3. WHEN the TUN interface is active THEN applications SHALL be completely unaware of the proxy
4. IF TUN interface creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
5. WHEN TUN mode is disabled THEN the virtual interface SHALL be cleanly removed

### Requirement 5: Traffic Analysis Prevention

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want the proxy to be undetectable by applications, so that proxy usage cannot be identified through traffic analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traffic is proxied transparently THEN timing patterns SHALL match direct connections as closely as possible
2. WHEN applications probe for proxy detection THEN the system SHALL respond as if no proxy exists
3. WHEN HTTP headers are processed THEN proxy-related headers SHALL be stripped or modified
4. IF applications use proxy detection techniques THEN the transparent proxy SHALL remain undetected
5. WHEN connection metadata is analyzed THEN it SHALL appear as direct connections

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure transparent proxy settings, so that I can control which traffic is intercepted and how.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring transparent mode THEN users SHALL be able to specify which ports to intercept
2. WHEN setting up transparent proxy THEN users SHALL be able to configure bypass rules for specific domains or IPs
3. WHEN transparent mode is configured THEN users SHALL receive clear setup instructions for their operating system
4. IF transparent mode requires special privileges THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the requirements
5. WHEN transparent proxy is running THEN users SHALL be able to monitor intercepted traffic through the management API

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user on different operating systems, I want transparent proxy to work on my platform, so that I can use the feature regardless of my OS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL support HTTP interception and system proxy configuration
2. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL support TUN interfaces and iptables integration
3. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL support system proxy configuration and network service integration
4. IF platform-specific features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative methods
5. WHEN platform limitations exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation of available features
